# Codebraid Preview

Codebraid Preview provides a [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)-based document
preview within [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  All of
[Pandoc's extensions](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) to
Markdown syntax are fully supportedâ€”because the preview is generated by
Pandoc itself!  The preview also includes built-in support for
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), [Org](https://orgmode.org/),
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html), and
[Textile](https://textile-lang.com/).  Codebraid Preview is compatible with
any text-based document format supported by Pandoc.  Additional formats can
typically be enabled by defining a few settings.

There is scroll sync between the document source and the preview for Markdown,
LaTeX, Org, reStructuredText, and Textile.  Scroll sync support can be
extended for additional formats.  Documents can be exported via Pandoc.
Several export formats are predefined, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, PowerPoint,
and Word.  Additional formats can be defined in settings.  There is optional
support for executing code blocks and inline code to embed their output in the
preview and in exported documents.  This is performed by
[Codebraid](https://github.com/gpoore/codebraid/) and is currently limited to
Markdown documents.

## Features

* **HTML preview of Pandoc documents.**  Open the preview by running the "Open
  Codebraid Preview" command (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type command).  Or, for
  document formats with built-in support, just click on the "Codebraid
  Preview" button in the status bar (bottom right).  When changes are
  detected, the preview automatically refreshes.

* **Full bidirectional scroll sync.**  Scroll sync between the document source
  and the preview is provided for Markdown, LaTeX, Org, reStructuredText, and
  Textile.  Scroll sync support can be extended for additional formats.  For
  formats with built-in Pandoc support, please open an issue on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/gpoore/codebraid-preview-vscode) to request
  scroll sync.  For custom formats, look in the Git repo under
  `pandoc/lib/readerlib.lua` and `pandoc/readers` for details about adding
  scroll sync using a short Lua wrapper script.

  For best scroll sync results with Markdown, use a
  [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)-based format (`commonmark_x`,
  `commonmark`, or `gfm`).  `commonmark_x` has
  [most of the features](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Roadmap#pandocs-markdown-transition-to-commonmark)
  in Pandoc's Markdown and continues to gain new features.

* **Math support with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).**  In Markdown documents,
  surround LaTeX math with single dollar signs `$` for inline math or double
  dollar signs `$$` for block math, following standard Pandoc conventions.
  KaTeX is also used to display math for other document formats.

* **Adjustable scroll sync directions.**  Once a preview window is open, click
  on the "Scroll" button in the status bar (bottom right) to toggle scroll
  mode.

* **Double-click to jump to source.**  Double-click in the preview, and jump
  to the start of the corresponding line in the document.

* **Jump to error.**  When a document is invalid, the preview displays the
  Pandoc parse error with a link that jumps to the corresponding source
  location.  This is particularly useful for formats like LaTeX.

* **Export documents with Pandoc (including Codebraid output).**  Simply click
  the "Pandoc" button in the status bar (bottom right), or use the "Export
  document with Pandoc" command (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type command).  Several
  export formats are predefined, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF,
  PowerPoint, and Word.  Additional formats can be defined in settings,
  under `codebraid.preview.pandoc.build`.

* **Scroll-sync support for multi-file documents.** Pandoc allows you to
  divide a document into multiple files that are combined into a single output
  document at build time.  Codebraid Preview can display such documents as
  long as all document files are in the same directory (folder).  For
  multi-file documents, create a YAML file that lists the document files to be
  combined.  For example, suppose your document is divided into `chapter_1.md`
  and `chapter_2.md`, both in the same directory.  Simply create a file named
  `_codebraid_preview.yaml` with this contents:

  ```
  input-files:
  - chapter_1.md
  - chapter_2.md
  ```

  Now, when you launch a preview in either `chapter_1.md` or `chapter_2.md`,
  both files will be combined in the preview.  When you scroll the preview,
  the editor will automatically switch between `chapter_1.md` and
  `chapter_2.md` depending on which part of the document you are viewing.
  That is, scroll sync works across multiple input files!

* **Execute code.** [Codebraid](https://github.com/gpoore/codebraid/) allows
  code blocks or inline code in Pandoc Markdown documents to be executed, with
  output embedded in the document.  Code execution is performed using Jupyter
  kernels or Codebraid's own built-in code execution system.  Simply add
  Codebraid attributes to your code, then click the "Codebraid" button in the
  status bar (bottom right) or use the "Run code with Codebraid" command
  (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type command).

  For example, to execute a Python fenced code block, simply add the
  attributes `{.python .cb-run}` immediately after the opening fence ` ``` `,
  so that the code block begins with ` ```{.python .cb-run}`.  Then click the
  Codebraid button.  To use a Jupyter kernel for code execution, with a notebook-style display of output, use
  ` ```{.python .cb-nb jupyter_kernel=python3}` in the first code block to be
  executed and ` ```{.python .cb-nb}` in subsequent code blocks.

  When you first load a document that uses Codebraid, any cached code output
  will automatically be loaded and displayed in the document.  The preview
  will automatically refresh when you make changes to the document outside of
  executed code.  However, code never runs automatically.  Code execution
  requires clicking the "Codebraid" button or using the "Run code with
  Codebraid" command.

  When code is running, the preview still updates whenever the document is
  modified, displaying all code output that is currently available.  The
  preview always remains live.


## Setup and requirements

### Pandoc

Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).  The latest version is recommended.
Version 3.1.1+ is required for scroll sync for formats besides `commonmark_x`,
`commonmark`, and `gfm`.  Versions before 2.17.1.1 may work but will have
reduced functionality, including scroll sync issues with YAML metadata.

### Default Markdown reader

By default, Markdown documents are treated as Pandoc's `commonmark_x` format,
since this provides the best scroll sync experience while still supporting
most Pandoc extensions to Markdown syntax.  If you need features that are only
available in Pandoc's Markdown (`markdown`), modify the extension setting
`codebraid.preview.pandoc.build`, under `*.md`, to change `reader` from
`commonmark_x` to `markdown`.  This will cause scroll sync to be less accurate
in some circumstances, since scroll sync data must be reconstructed by
Codebraid Preview instead of being generated by Pandoc itself.

### Codebraid

For code execution, install the latest version of
[Codebraid](https://github.com/gpoore/codebraid/).  Codebraid currently only
supports code execution in Markdown documents.

### Security

You may want to review the default security settings under
`codebraid.preview.security`.  For example, if you are using remote images,
you will need to enable `codebraid.preview.security.allowRemoteImages`.  If
you are using Codebraid with Jupyter output that involves scripts, then you
will need to enable inline scripts or local scripts.


## Adding support for additional input formats

To add basic support for an additional document format, simply create a
defaults file in the document directory that specifies `from` or `reader`.
See setting `codebraid.preview.pandoc.defaultsFile`.  Or define an additional
file extension under `codebraid.preview.pandoc.build`.

For formats with built-in Pandoc support, please open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/gpoore/codebraid-preview-vscode) to request scroll
sync.  For custom formats, look in the Git repo under
`pandoc/lib/readerlib.lua` and `pandoc/readers` for details about adding
scroll sync using a short Lua wrapper script.

### Jupyter notebooks

The preview is compatible with Jupyter notebooks (`ipynb`).  Simply add the
following to `settings.json`, under `codebraid.preview.pandoc.build`:
```
"*.ipynb": {
    "reader": "ipynb",
    "preview": {
        "html": {
            "defaults": {},
            "options": []
        }
    },
    "export": {}
},
```
Jupyter notebooks have some limitations compared to other formats.  Scroll
sync is not currently supported.  The preview currently only updates when the
notebook is saved; the preview does not update live as you type.

VS Code already provides a
[built-in notebook editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
A Pandoc-based preview for Jupyter notebooks will primarily be useful when
Pandoc filters or similar features are used to customize a notebook during
export.



## A note on input formats and `commonmark_x`

By default, Markdown documents are treated as Pandoc's `commonmark_x` format,
which is different from Pandoc's default `markdown` format.  Scroll sync data
is only generated by Pandoc for CommonMark-based formats, and `commonmark_x`
is the most powerful of these.  For other formats, Codebraid Preview must
reconstruct scroll sync data, and this can be less accurate in some
circumstances.

The [Pandoc Roadmap](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Roadmap#pandocs-markdown-transition-to-commonmark)
provides details about `commonmark_x` features.  `commonmark_x` currently
lacks some `markdown` features that are summarized below.  If you need these
features, you can switch the input format to `markdown` by modifying the
extension setting `codebraid.preview.pandoc.build`, under `*.md`, to change
`reader` from `commonmark_x` to `markdown`.  Or you can create a
defaults file `_codebraid_preview.yaml` in the document directory and set
`from: markdown` in it.  Keep in mind that switching to `markdown` will
make scroll sync less accurate in some circumstances.

Summary of some key features not present in `commonmark_x` compared to
`markdown`:

* **Citations**:  Not currently supported, but planned.

* **Tables**:  Grid tables, multiline tables, simple tables, and table
  captions are not supported but planned.  Pipe tables are supported.

* **LaTeX math**:  Only `$` and `$$` are supported as delimiters.  Variations
  on `\(...\)` and `\[...\]` are not supported.

* **Raw LaTeX**:  LaTeX cannot just be mixed with Markdown text.  Instead, raw
  attributes must be used.  So instead of `text \command text` use something
  like ``text `\command`{=tex} text``.

* **LaTeX macros**:  User-defined LaTeX macros are not expanded by Pandoc
  itself before document conversion (the `latex_macros` extension is not
  supported), so the output format must handle macro expansion.  This is
  primarily important for non-LaTeX formats.

  In a document using LaTeX math but targeting a non-LaTeX format like HTML,
  this can mean that macro definitions belong in a LaTeX math block and must
  be made global.  For example, the `markdown` document
  ```
  \newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1\rangle}

  $\tuple{a, b, c}$
  ```
  might become the `commonmark_x` document
  ```
  $$
  \newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1\rangle}
  \global\let\tuple\tuple
  $$

  $\tuple{a, b, c}$
  ```
  The exact details of macro definition processing will depend somewhat on how
  LaTeX math is rendered and on the configuration of the renderer.


## A note on filters

Scroll sync is provided for CommonMark-based formats using Pandoc's
`sourcepos` extension.  For other formats with scroll sync, Codebraid Preview
provides an emulation of `sourcepos`.  In either case, this inserts `Div` and
`Span` nodes into the Pandoc AST that contain information about source file
origin location in a `data-pos` attribute.  If you use filters with your
documents and want to make sure that the preview is accurate while retaining
scroll sync capabilities, make sure that your filters skip these nodes and
only remove them if empty.  For example, in a Lua filter these nodes can be
detected by checking `node.attributes['data-pos'] ~= nil`.


## Known limitations

Some Pandoc options have limited preview support or require special settings.

* `--embed-resources`:  Version 0.15.0 added support for `--embed-resources`
  (and deprecated `--self-contained`).  This option may not work when the path
  to the VS Code extension installation location contains spaces.  Currently,
  the setting `codebraid.preview.security.allowEmbeddedScripts` must be
  enabled for some features that rely on JavaScript, such as KaTeX math.
  Note that when using `--embed-resources`, setting `allowEmbeddedScripts` to
  `true` effectively allows *all* JavaScript, so this should only be used with
  documents that you trust.


## Extension settings

### Document build and display

* `codebraid.preview.css.overrideDefault` [`true`]:  Whether document CSS
  overrides the preview's default CSS (determines which is loaded last).

* `codebraid.preview.css.useDefault` [`true`]:  Whether the preview's default
  CSS is used.

* `codebraid.preview.minBuildInterval` [`1000`]:  Minimum interval between
  document builds in milliseconds.  Builds only occur when there are changes.

### Pandoc

* `codebraid.preview.pandoc.build` [`<default config for several formats>`]:
  This is where file extensions are associated with Pandoc build settings for
  preview and export.  For example, here is the default entry for Markdown
  documents:

  ```
  "*.md": {
    "reader": "commonmark_x",
    "preview": {"html": {"defaults": {}, "options": []}},
    "export": {}
  },
  ```

  `reader` determines the input format that Pandoc uses for files with this
  file extension.  If a custom Lua reader is used instead of a built-in Pandoc
  format, it must be quoted appropriately for usage within a shell.  It will
  be passed to Pandoc as a command-line option in a child process.

  `preview` determine how the HTML preview is built.  By default, there is
  only a single preview build configuration for HTML.  It is possible to
  create multiple preview configurations.  Then, when you start the preview,
  you will be prompted to select the appropriate configuration.  For example,
  this creates an additional preview configuration with a custom highlighting
  style and a table of contents:

  ```
  "preview": {
    "html": {"defaults": {}, "options": []},
    "custom (highlight kate, table of contents)": {
      "writer": "html",
      "defaults": {"highlight-style": "kate"},
      "options": ["--toc"]
    }
  }
  ```

  In this case, the name of one configuration (`custom ...`) is not a Pandoc
  writer, so the configuration must specify a writer name explicitly
  (`"writer": "html"`).  The `defaults` values are saved in a Pandoc defaults
  file and are used as fallback values.  They can be overridden by `options`
  or by values specified in user defaults files (such as
  `codebraid.preview.pandoc.defaultsFile`).  The `options` values are
  command-line options.  Each array element must be a single option, for
  example, `["--filter FILTER"]`.  They must be quoted appropriately for being
  used in a shell.  Because they are command-line options that are passed to
  the Pandoc executable, they override `defaults` and also user defaults
  files.

  `export` is similar to `preview`, except that it specifies build
  configurations for export rather than preview.  These custom export
  configurations are added to the predefined export configurations that are
  always available.

  Within a build configuration, `writer` (if present) and `options` will be
  used within a shell and must be quoted appropriately.  Under Windows, a
  leading unquoted `~/` or `~\` in `writer` or in an option value will be
  expanded to the user's home directory (`os.homedir()`), since this is not
  done by the shell.

* `codebraid.preview.pandoc.defaultsFile` [`_codebraid_preview.yaml`]: Special
  [Pandoc defaults file](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#defaults-files) in the
  document directory that is used for previewing and exporting documents.

  Almost all Pandoc defaults options are supported.  If the defaults file
  includes additional external defaults files by setting `defaults`, then the
  following options in those additional external defaults files will be
  ignored:  `input-files`, `input-file`, `from`, `reader`, `to`, `writer`, and
  `file-scope`.  The preview must know the values of these options to function
  correctly, and it does not attempt to replicate Pandoc's system for locating
  and merging multiple defaults files.

  While almost all defaults options are supported, keep in mind that some
  options or option values are irrelevant or inappropriate.  The preview is
  HTML, so avoid options that do not affect HTML, are incompatible with HTML,
  result in non-HTML output, or redirect the output.

  If the defaults file is modified within VS Code, the preview will
  automatically detect changes and update.  If the defaults file is modified
  in another editor, close and restart the preview for changes to be applied.

  If the defaults file exists and it defines `input-files`, then the preview
  will automatically work with all files in a multi-file document.  If the
  defaults file defines `input-files` (or `input-file`), then it will only be
  applied to the specified files; it will be ignored for other files.

  If the defaults file defines `input-files` (or `input-file`), all specified
  files must be in the same directory with the defaults file.  Document files
  in subdirectories are not supported.

* `codebraid.preview.pandoc.extraEnv` [`{}`]:  Additional environment
  variables that are set for the Pandoc subprocess used to generate the
  preview and to export documents.

* `codebraid.preview.pandoc.executable` [`pandoc`]:  Pandoc executable.  This
  is used within a shell, so it must be appropriately quoted and escaped.

* `codebraid.preview.pandoc.showRaw` [`true`]:  Display a verbatim
  representation of non-HTML raw content (Pandoc Markdown `{=format}`) in the
  preview.

### Security

The HTML preview is displayed using a webview.  These settings determine which
local and remote resources, such as images and scripts, can be loaded by the
webview.  **These settings only determine the resources that the webview can
load.  They do not affect the resources that Pandoc can access or determine
which resources Pandoc can embed in the HTML preview document (see note
below).**

By default, all remote resources are disabled.  By default, local resources
can only be loaded from the current workspace folders, the document directory,
and the default Pandoc user data directory (see output of `pandoc --version`
for location).  Additional local locations can be added via
`security.extraLocalResourceRoots`.  All types of local resources are
permitted by default except for scripts.  Inline scripts are also not
permitted by default, except for those bundled as part of the extension.

Scripting capabilities should only be enabled when using documents that you
trust.  Styles (CSS), particularly when combined with images/media or fonts,
can also have security implications, especially when remote resources are
involved.

**Note on limitations of security settings**:  Many security settings
determine which resources the webview can load.  However, the Pandoc option
`--embed-resources` uses `data:` URIs to incorporate the contents of linked
scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos directly into the HTML.  If you
choose to use `--embed-resources`, be aware that this makes these security
settings irrelevant, since content is embedded in the HTML rather than being
loaded from a local or remote source.  Similarly, `--extract-media` makes most
image and media security settings irrelevant, because it copies or downloads
all images and media to a local temp directory that is accessible by default.
`--extract-media` is required to preview Jupyter notebooks and is
automatically enabled only for that case.

*Inline*

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowInlineScripts` [`false`]:  Allow the
  preview to use inline scripts `<script>...</script>`.  (Scripts bundled as
  part of the extension are always allowed.)

*Embedded*

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowEmbeddedFonts` [`true`]:  Allow the preview
  to load fonts from `data:` URLs.  This is helpful when using
  `--embed-resources` (or deprecated `--self-contained`) to embed resources in
  the preview document rather than loading them from local or remote
  locations.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowEmbeddedImages` [`true`]:  Allow the
  preview to load images from `data:` URLs.  This is helpful when using
  `--embed-resources` (or deprecated `--self-contained`) to embed resources in
  the preview document rather than loading them from local or remote
  locations.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowEmbeddedMedia` [`true`]:  Allow the preview
  to load media from `data:` URLs.  This is helpful when using
  `--embed-resources` (or deprecated `--self-contained`) to embed resources in
  the preview document rather than loading them from local or remote
  locations.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowEmbeddedScripts` [`false`]:  Allow the
  preview to load scripts from `data:` URLs.  This is helpful when using
  `--embed-resources` (or deprecated `--self-contained`) to embed resources in
  the preview document rather than loading them from local or remote
  locations.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowEmbeddedStyles` [`true`]:  Allow the
  preview to load styles from `data:` URLs.  This is helpful when using
  `--embed-resources` (or deprecated `--self-contained`) to embed resources in
  the preview document rather than loading them from local or remote
  locations.

*Local*

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowLocalFonts` [`true`]:  Allow the preview to
  load fonts from the current workspace folder, the document directory, the
  default Pandoc user data directory (if enabled via
  `security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot`), and any other locations
  specified in `security.extraLocalResourceRoots`.  (Fonts bundled as part of
  the extension are always allowed.)

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowLocalImages` [`true`]:  Allow the preview
  to load images from the current workspace folder, the document directory,
  the default Pandoc user data directory (if enabled via
  `security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot`), and any other locations
  specified in `security.extraLocalResourceRoots`.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowLocalMedia` [`true`]:  Allow the preview to
  load media from the current workspace folder, the document directory, the
  default Pandoc user data directory (if enabled via
  `security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot`), and any other locations
  specified in `security.extraLocalResourceRoots`.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowLocalScripts` [`false`]:  Allow the preview
  to load scripts from the current workspace folder, the document directory,
  the default Pandoc user data directory (if enabled via
  `security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot`), and any other locations
  specified in `security.extraLocalResourceRoots`.  (Scripts bundled as part
  of the extension are always allowed.)

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowLocalStyles` [`true`]:  Allow the preview
  to load styles from the current workspace folder, the document directory,
  the default Pandoc user data directory (if enabled via
  `security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot`), and any other locations
  specified in `security.extraLocalResourceRoots`.  (Styles bundled as part of
  the extension are always allowed.)

*Remote*

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowRemoteFonts` [`false`]:  Allow the preview
  to load fonts from remote locations via https.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowRemoteImages` [`false`]:  Allow the preview
  to load images from remote locations via https.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowRemoteMedia` [`false`]:  Allow the preview
  to load media from remote locations via https.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowRemoteScripts` [`false`]:  Allow the
  preview to load scripts from remote locations via https.

* `codebraid.preview.security.allowRemoteStyles` [`false`]:  Allow the preview
  to load styles from remote locations via https.

*Resource roots*

* `codebraid.preview.security.extraLocalResourceRoots` [none]:  Additional
  root paths from which the preview can load local (filesystem) resources,
  such as images and CSS.  These are in addition to the current workspace
  folders, the document directory, and the default Pandoc user data directory
  (if enabled via `security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot`).

  Paths may be absolute or relative.  In absolute paths, a leading `~/` is
  expanded to the user's home directory.  Relative paths are relative to the
  document file; for example, `../images` refers to an `images` directory one
  level up from the document.  For setting `extraLocalResourceRoots` paths,
  either absolute or relative paths are fine.  Within a document, relative
  paths should be preferred because they will automatically work with the
  preview's webview.  If you use absolute paths, you will typically need to
  build a document with `--embed-resources` for resources to load correctly.

* `codebraid.preview.security.pandocDefaultDataDirIsResourceRoot` [`true`].
  Add the default Pandoc user data directory to the root paths from which the
  preview can load local (filesystem) resources, such as images and CSS.  See
  `--data-dir` in the
  [Pandoc documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#general-options) for
  details about the data directory.  See the output of `pandoc --version` for
  the location of the data directory on your system.


## Codebraid configuration

When Codebraid is used to run code, the `codebraid` executable is found by
searching the following locations.

1. If a Python interpreter is set in VS Code, the interpreter installation is
   checked for a `codebraid` executable.

   Notice that a Python interpreter can be set at the file level or workspace
   level (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, then `Python: Select Interpreter`, or configure
   `python.defaultInterpreterPath` in a workspace `settings.json`).  A Python
   interpreter can also be configured in global User Settings (File,
   Preferences, Settings, `Python: Default Interpreter Path`).  Only the first
   Python interpreter that is set in the file/workspace/global sequence is
   checked for a `codebraid` executable.

   For more details about configuring Python in VS Code, see
   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments.

2. If a Python interpreter is not set, or its installation does not include a
   `codebraid` executable, then the first `codebraid` executable on PATH is
   used.  There will be a warning message if a Python interpreter is set but
   does not include `codebraid`, so that `codebraid` on PATH is used as a
   fallback.

If the `codebraid` executable is part of an
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installation, it is
launched via `conda run` so that the relevant conda environment is activated.
For other environments and installations, the `codebraid` executable is run
directly.


## Security

The HTML preview is displayed using a webview.  A content security policy is
used to restrict what is possible in the webview.  Inline styles are
permitted.  Local resources associated with a document, except for scripts,
are enabled by default.  All remote resources are disabled by default.  To
customize webview capabilities, see settings under
`codebraid.preview.security`.  All resources bundled with the extension
(styles, fonts, and scripts) are always allowed, to support features like
KaTeX math and scroll sync.

Code is never automatically executed with Codebraid.  Code is only ever
executed when a Codebraid class is added to a code block or inline code, and
then the "Codebraid" button is clicked (or the "Run code with Codebraid"
command is invoked).
